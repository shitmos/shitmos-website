### rules for code journal
make your own file or files, with whatever naming convention you want, in whatever format you want to talk about:

1. stuff you have created and added
2. stuff you are building or updating
3. stuff that you hope to accomplish

The goal here is that a system will emerge from the chaos, and interested parties can get a look into what's going on if they wish to take a deep dive.
