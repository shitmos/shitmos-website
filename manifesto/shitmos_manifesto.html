        <h1>Shitmos Manifesto</h1>
        <p><em>By kaufybeans with help and inspiration from the Shitmos community</em></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            We, the average Cosmos user, came to Cosmos after getting into crypto investing and then doing some research on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency ecosystems. We landed on Cosmos because we felt it had a superior vision and better underlying technology. We were convinced by the power of modularity, sovereignty, inter-blockchain communication and asset sending, the Cosmos Hub as port city, and the app-chain thesis. We bought increasing amounts of ATOM, JUNO, OSMO, and others. We knew “every chain is a Cosmos chain, they just don’t know it yet.” We knew we were right. But therein, we succumbed to the greatest of crypto investing blunders: “Do you want to be right, or do you want to make money?” We wanted to be right. And we certainly did not make money. The Cosmos ecosystem has underperformed many of its peers, most notably Solana. Every couple of months, some new Cosmos project is hyped up and released, claims to solve some major pain point in blockchain technology, and approximately 3.5 people care. Cosmos is on a tiresome treadmill, and the token prices are either stagnant, or dropping. And yet, as Cosmos users, we are not just self-pitying and self-hating, we are also self-righteous. We still know we are right. We just want to finally make money. Yet it seems that most Cosmos projects and tokens are failing to generate the kind of excitement and fun that makes large numbers of people want to gamble their hard-earned money in hopes of pulling a 1000x. Enter Shitmos.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shitmos has the power to unify the Cosmos in its self-hatred, self-pity, and self-righteousness. How? It’s fun. And funny. It’s both a shitcoin and has actual utility. It is a vehicle through which we can vent our frustrations with Cosmos while also being a totem upon which we can pin our hopes for salvation. It both mocks Cosmos while subconsciously glorifying it, as only an avid Cosmos user could ever dream it up. If you love Cosmos, you should buy Shitmos. If you hate Cosmos, you should buy Shitmos. The omni-directional shit-layer of irony and ambiguity give it a mithril-level hardness to protect against virtually any charge. So, what exactly is Shitmos? To answer that, we must begin with a brief history of the Cosmos.
        </p>

        <h2>The Holy Shitmos History</h2>

        <h3>Geneshits</h3>
        <p>
            In the beginning, Jae Kwon created the Cosmos out of the blockvoid. He then teamed up with Ethan Buchman, and later others, to form All In Bits. Jae and Ethan laid the foundations of the Cosmos. But then Jae went insane and labelled all others heretics and Ethan became a rapper named Tanuki. Yeah, it’s bat-shit. The supernova of that explosion of lunacy sent the lesser Cosmos demigods flying through the Cosmos, trying to invent new blockchain worlds to inhabit. Demigods such as Sunny and Zaki. Amidst the chaos, enough order was created that enabled the formation of the early Cosmos. Sunny became the God of Osmosis. Jake Hartnell the God of Juno. Jack Zampolin the God of I’m Not Really Sure What But He’s Definitely Very Important. And Zaki the God of Various Cosmos Projects And If You’re Not Sure If He Is The God Of A Cosmos Project, He Is. The early Cosmos showed promise. It was a time of optimism. A time of exorbitant LP rewards. A time of wonder and, yes, even profits. But the good times did not last long. As the 2021 bull run wound down, Cosmos was hit hardest. This was mostly due to the Icarus of Cosmos, Do Kwon, who flew too close to the sun, and imploded a $100 Billion cryptocurrency. The shockwaves of that implosion sent Cosmos prices barreling towards 0.
        </p>

        <h3>Exodus</h3>
        <p>
            After 2 years of wandering in the bear market desert, the various crypto peoples of the world finally started finding ways out of the wilderness. The bear market couldn’t last forever, and signs of life started to emerge. A former Cosmos prophet, Ansem, began preaching a different Gospel, the Good News of Solana. He gained many followers, and they pamped. So much pamp. An enraging amount of pamp. The kind of pamp that made the Cosmos citizens feel humiliated. After a brief upswing in Cosmos prices, and even an impressive breakout of Cosmos’s OG meme coin, HUAHUA, all went to shit once again. Cosmos users were poor, and there was a dog coin being sent to the Vegas Sphere. With a hat. And the solana bros were rich. It was a dark time for the Cosmos, and many Cosmos users left.
        </p>

        <h3>The Gospel According to Flarnrules</h3>
        <p>
            Out of Stargaze came an NFT artist named flarnrules. He was a simple man. A Cosmos user. He began to have visions of saving the Cosmos from itself. He joined a commune of shitcoin zealots who created the start cooking app. A place of creation. The creation of shit. Shitcoins, that is. One day, while strolling through the Cosmos, he had a vision of a crypto project that was like Cosmos, but shit. He immediately understood the paradox of the vision. Cosmos is shit. So how can something be like cosmos, but shit? What he did not yet understand is that while his mind had been corrupted by the trials and tribulations of the Cosmos, his heart remained pure. He still believed in the Cosmos. He still knew that the Cosmos had the best tools for creating and maintaining crypto projects. The Cosmos merely lacked fun. And the demigods of Cosmos did not have the power to create fun. Their powers of creation remained only in the realm of esoteric blockchain problems. In order to bring about a new Cosmos, where the roads are paved in gold, it was up to us Cosmos plebs to create the fun we want to see in the Cosmos. And in so doing, improve the apps and clear out the shit-layer of confusion and difficulty so that poor end users like ourselves can create that fun that we want to see in the Cosmos. The good news, the gospel, was that Cosmos was not dead. Upon this realization, he fell to the ground and convulsed. And shit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once he regained his strength, and changed his pants, he set about creating a new shitcoin. It was inspired by that which he loved, Cosmos. To make Cosmos fun again, this shitcoin needed a shit-layer of ambiguity. It had to incorporate an attitude of humor, even of parody, without devolving into negativity. It had to be self-aware, but also able to deflect into irony. He named the coin Shitmos, and launched it on the start cooking app. While there were initial ups and downs, he never lost faith, and eventually Shitmos was fully cooked onto Osmosis.
        </p>
        <p>
            While this was going on, flarnrules also wielded the power of creation to generate an NFT collection, also called Shitmos. He knew, even then, that a shitcoin was not enough to save the Cosmos, for Cosmos lacked culture, and culture needs art. He set about creating an NFT collection that drew upon crypto culture while focusing mainly on the history of Cosmos. It included the likenesses of the various Cosmos demigods, prophets, and false prophets. It brought back from the darkness of the collective Cosmos memory epic failures such as Neta, Raw, and Fortis Oeconomia. Those who saw it laughed and wept. For the first time, an average Cosmos pleb felt seen. After years of lurking on Cosmos Twitter, many felt that the Cosmos drama, its main characters and projects, its epic failures, its governance embarrassments had become the background reality TV show of their lives. They finally had an artistic endeavor that made them realize that they had culture all along. And they began to believe that Cosmos could be saved.
        </p>

        <h3>The Acts of the A-piss-les</h3>
        <p>
            While many Cosmos users began to feel a drop of hope, they also asked themselves, “so what does Shitmos do? What can it do? How will it act in the Cosmos to bring about unity, hope, and profit? To answer this, one must understand the Holy Shit Trinity. Shitmos is a coin, an NFT collection, and an economic zone. It contains three distinct manifestations. Fully coin, fully NFT, and fully economic zone. Shitmos is a crypto token. It can be traded, held, and even staked to the Shitmos Hub. When the NFT collection launched, the top 150 Shitmos token holders were airdropped 2 Shitmos NFTs. It was supposed to be only 1, but Shitmos is like Cosmos, but shit. So these things happen sometimes. Nonetheless, in the process the Shitmos token obtained its first utility: NFT airdrop. In those early days, no Shitmos DAO had yet taken form in the Cosmos, so staking was not possible. But now, as the Kingdom of Shit is at hand, a DAO has been created. Shitmos token holders can now stake their Shitmos coins to the DAO, granting them the power to vote on governance proposals. They may even one day receive airdrops and staking rewards as the DAO vision comes to pass.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Shitmos is fully a coin, it is also fully an NFT collection. The official Shitmos NFT collection contains 2,222 masterpieces of Cosmos-inspired art. In addition to the value proposition of holding an artistic masterpiece, Shitmos NFTs are endowed with many other value propositions and utilities. First, holding a Shitmos NFT that is not listed for sale means that you will regularly receive a double dribble. A double dribble is the sending of 2.22 Shitmos tokens for each unlisted Shitmos NFT a wallet holds. These Shitmos tokens come from the buying of Shitmos tokens using royalties from sales of Shitmos NFTs on Stargaze, the premier NFT marketplace and launchpad for NFTs in the Cosmos. Holding a Shitmos NFT may also make you eligible for White Lists on other NFT collections, as Shitmos is becoming one of the top NFT collections on Stargaze. Furthermore, a DAO exists for NFT holders called the Shitmos Economic Zone. NFT holders can stake their Shitmos NFTs to the DAO, participate in governance, potentially receive airdrops, and help manage the DAO treasury. Prophecy has also foretold that staked Shitmos NFTs may one day be eligible for a double dribble multiplier, meaning staked NFTs could one day receive more Shitmos tokens in each double dribble event than unstaked NFTs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, the third manifestation of the Holy Shit Trinity is the Shitmos Economic Zone. The Shitmos Economic Zone is a growing family of Stargaze NFT collections who have seen the light and want to work together to save the Cosmos by making Cosmos fun again. SEZ members pledge to do one or both of two things: first, send a small portion of royalties from their collection to the Shitmos Economic Zone wallet. Second, to use another portion of their royalties to buy Shitmos tokens that are then distributed to the holders of NFTs in their own collection. Being an SEZ member means that a member collection gets the prestige of being a member while also gaining visibility among the growing number of Shitmos zealots who can help support their project. SEZ members may also be eligible for the Shitgeyser, which is the distribution of Shitmos tokens from the Shitmos Economic Zone wallet to the NFT member collections with the largest contributions to the SEZ. The more royalties a member generates for the SEZ wallet, the more likely they will be blessed by the Shitgeyser.
        </p>

        <h2>Call to Action</h2>
        <p>
            So how can you, a regular Cosmos pleb, help bring about the Kingdom of Shit and restore the Cosmos to its proper place as a top-3 alt-chain ecosystem? By joining the cause and helping to manifest the Shitmos Mission Statement. What you will find in this section are a mixture of current strategies to manifest the mission statement along with meditations on the efficacy of various strategies and suggestions for possible future strategies. The best way for you to help bring about the Kingdom of Shit is to get involved, stake Shitmos tokens and NFTs to their respective DAOs, and help the community of a-piss-les come up with ideas to grow the Kingdom and bring about peace and prosperity in the Cosmos.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Mission Statement: Simple. Shitmos coin to the moon</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>Strategies to Grow Shitmos and Create Utility</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Develop and Then Clearly and Consistently Communicate the Utility and Narrative of the Shitmos Coin (and NFT Collection)</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The utility of the coin and NFT collection is well-established and growing by the day. NFT holders receive regular airdrops of Shitmos coins in the form of double dribbles that come from revenue generated by the SEZ wallet getting royalties from Shitmos NFT sales. Holders may also be eligible for WL on new collections on Stargaze, especially from the growing community of SEZ members. The coin’s utility is hopefully “number go up.” But beyond that, we now have a Shitmos Hub DAO where you can stake Shitmos coins and potentially be eligible for future airdrops or staking rewards, if such rewards are made possible through community-generated ideas and governance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Narrative is a harder nut to crack (or shit to push out). One of the main advantages of Shitmos is that it has what could be called “omni-narrative.” More than one narrative works very well for Shitmos as a project. One narrative is that it is a group of avid Cosmos users who love Cosmos and its technology but are disappointed in the price action of the vast majority of Cosmos coins. Another could be that a group of avid Cosmos users who believe in the underlying Cosmos technology and blockchain vision, but are disappointed in how it has all played out (devs being greedy, too much devcel attitudes, too much focus on esoteric blockchain problems while not focusing on what users want, etc.). Another is a group of avid Cosmos users who were on the wrong side of the classic “do you want to be right or do you want to make money” conundrum. We wanted to be right. But we didn’t make money. Now we want to be right AND make money. Another is Shitmos as the South Park parody-esque Cosmos alter-ego. Another could be Cosmos as It Should Have Been (i.e., the Shitmos Economic Zone is actually displaying the spirit of what the ATOM Economic Zone wants to be). Another could be tailored to people outside the Cosmos ecosystem such as “think your ecosystem is better and that Cosmos sucks? Prove it by pumping Shitmos, the coin that shits on cosmos!” The point is that there are many, many possible narratives. Different community members can choose/invent their own. But here are two things to consider: First, be able to consistently communicate a narrative in a compelling/humorous/attractive way. Know your narrative and build on it. Second, don’t devolve into Cosmos hate. If Shitmos is to attract big players and large wallets, we need to win people over, many of whom have dedicated massive amounts of time and energy building the tools and blockchains in Cosmos. If we seem to be too much hating on Cosmos, it may turn off some of the biggest names in Cosmos. We can be disappointed in Cosmos, frustrated with Cosmos, disheartened with our net worth from what we’ve dumped into Cosmos. But ultimately, it should be remembered that Shitmos is here to redeem Cosmos because Cosmos is worthy of being saved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Different people will choose/develop different narratives. And different people will be won over and convinced by different narratives. If we want to grow the community and win as many people over and convince as many people as possible to buy Shitmos Coins and NFTs, we need strong narratives. The more people we win over, the more buy pressure for Shitmos coin.
        </p>
        <p>
            P.S. People want to hang out with the cool kids. Be a cool kid. Don’t be lame. Be an evangelist, but don’t be annoying. Throw the occasional fishing line out toward a big-name Cosmos person, but don’t be a nagging reply guy.
        </p>
        <ol start="2">
            <li><strong>Achieve As High a Trading Volume of Shitmos NFTs as Possible For As Long As Possible</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If it were easy, everybody would do it for every NFT collection ever launched. Luckily, Shitmos has a solid foundation: the NFT collection is awesome. It’s funny. It’s South Park-esque. It’s a celebration of Cosmos as if it were all of our background reality TV show over the last few years. It also has the benefit of a shit-layer of ambiguity and irony. Is it mocking Cosmos and the people in it? Celebrating it? Teasing it in a light-hearted yet sometimes pointed way? Yes. All of the above. In a reality TV show, some viewers like the villain. Is Zaki a good guy or bad guy? Is he being lampooned or acknowledged as a Cosmos Main Character? Again, all of the above and in the eye of the shit holder.
        </p>
        <p>
            The more we win people over through the narrative, NFT collection, and the utility of holding Shitmos NFTs and Shitmos coins, the greater the demand will be for the NFTs, and the more volume will be generated. If we can achieve a floor price on par with some of the most successful Stargaze NFT collections, a weekly volume of 1M STARS is not out of the question. So how can we get there and how can you participate?
        </p>
        <p>
            Create scarcity by making it worth it to stake NFTs to the Shitmos Economic Zone DAO. The more NFTs that are staked to the DAO, the less that are available for sale at any point in time. The greater the scarcity and the greater the demand, the higher the price. The higher the price, the more each sale contributes to volume. If floor price is 25k, it only takes 4 sales a day to hit 100k STARS volume per day and 700k STARS volume per week. Which, at prices as of July 20, 2024 and as per the current splits contract, is enough STARS to purchase enough Shitmos coins for 2 double dribbles per week. 1 double dribble per week would be extremely healthy for long term sustainability. 2 would be shit gravy. Why would people stake NFTs to the DAO? Possible future multipliers on double dribbles, possible extras from dingleberries, possible WL spots, etc. One way you can contribute is to help the community develop as much utility as possible for staking Shitmos NFTs to the Shitmos Economic Zone DAO.
        </p>
        <p>
            Weaknesses: There are often weaknesses or limitations to any strategy. In this case, volume is about velocity. Buying and selling as fast as possible. The more you take out of circulation, the less there are to rapidly buy and sell. There is a tension between creating incentives to hold/stake the Shitmos NFTs and wanting NFT sales velocity. It may be difficult to resolve/ameliorate this tension. Could we dream up some way to incentivize selling as well as buying? Could there be competitions on who can make the most profit on NFT sales in a week? Highest increase in price from last purchase to current purchase? Anything is possible. By becoming an active community member and by staking NFTs to the DAO, you can participate in both informal community discussions and official governance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Promotions and competitions that encourage people to buy. Promotions/events/airdrops like dingleberries can be a great way to generate volume. People like free shit. If you can give away Shitmos coins or NFTs (or something else of value) then people may buy if they feel they are getting more for their money. Offer a free NFT to the next person to floor sweep the bottom three Shitmos NFTs, and they realize they are getting 4 for the price of 3. Community discussions have already taken place to develop ideas for promotions and giveaways like this. Such events and promotions can generate volume and drive up the floor price. If the unconverted (future Shitmos fans) see the FP going up, they may FOMO in to make money.
        </p>
        <p>
            Weaknesses: Some promotions may not work as well as envisioned. As an active community member (join our Telegram!), you can help us determine which promotions work best.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Shitmos NFTs become more valuable and sought-after, holders could receive more airdrops and WL spots (like Bad Kids and Sloths). If the community grows large enough and if the NFT volume and price continues to pick up, Shitmos could enter Bad Kids/Mad Scientists territory. Want to help make this happen?

        <ol start="3">
            <li><strong>OEs</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Open Edition NFT collections are collections where all art pieces are the same. There is no uniqueness or rarity to different pieces. It is the same piece of art that many people can own. The number in the collection is typically smaller, and the mint price is typically low (due to the lack of rarity or uniqueness between the pieces). They are a great way to get a solid injection of revenue for buying Shitmos tokens. A collection of 222 pieces that sell for 2.22 USDC, for example, generates $492.84 (minus whatever goes to Stargaze or to the artist collaborator) in revenue. While OEs takes a fair amount of work to create and index, it is not nearly the amount of work that it takes to generate a 2000+ collection of unique pieces. Two OE collections have been released so far by the Shitmos Economic Zone wallet and can be currently found on the marketplace in Stargaze. It is likely that more will be released in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Limitations/Weaknesses: First, because all pieces are identical, trading of these items after the first few days will taper off quite a bit. After the initial burst of revenue, you cannot count on much from royalties. Secondly, you can run the risk of OE fatigue. Certainly a small, core group of diehards will continue to mint OEs. But it is possible that over time, even fairly strong Shitmos fans may pass on an upcoming OE, feeling it isn’t worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mitigations: First, grow the community. The bigger the community, the larger the number of diehards who will consistently show up (and perhaps even fight for) an OE mint. Sufficient size negates OE fatigue, because with a large enough community, some will miss out on one OE, so will still be eager to grab the next one. Secondly, it could be possible to give utility to holding OE pieces. For example, “if you hold some number of different OE pieces”…more WL spots, occasionally shit dribbles, perhaps it’s on the wheel for dingleberries, etc. By giving some utility to holding OE pieces, it would increase people’s desire to hold them and, perhaps, their value. So how can you help? Pick up a Shitmos OE NFT today! Also, join the community and become an active member to help us determine the best ways to create value for everything (include OE NFT collections) that comes out of Shitmos.
        </p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li><strong>The Shitmos Hub DAO</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            As mentioned earlier, an addition to the Shitmos Economic Zone DAO where you can stake your Shitmos NFTs, there is also a Shitmos Hub DAO where you can stake your Shitmos tokens. At the moment, the main utility of this is to participate in governance. However, there are other utilities for the Hub; some are currently in place and some could happen in the future.
        </p>
        <h4>4A. The Shitmos Hub DAO Treasury is a repository for shitcoins.</h4>
        <p>
            Another original purpose for the Shitmos Hub is to be a repository for shitcoins. People can donate shitcoins to the Hub Treasury, and the community can then decide what to do with them. One aspect of this is the semi-ridiculous nature of sending mostly worthless shitcoins to the DAO of a literal shit coin. Another, however, is a viable way for creators of new shit coins to market their coin and spread out the distribution of the token through we what call airdrips. For example, if someone wants to create a new shit coin on Osmosis, they can minimize the effect of a small number of wallets at the top from hoarding all the coins and being in a position to nuke the coin. They can send, say, 2.22% of the supply to the Shitmos Hub Treasury. The Shitmos Hub stakers can then decide what to do with those coins (hold, distribute, airdrop to NFT holders, etc.). This has the additional benefit of marketing the new shitcoin to a community of active and enthusiastic shitcoin holders, which can create more buying for that new shitcoin. Which, in turn, can pump the price of the shitcoin, increasing the value held in the Shitmos Hub DAO Treasury. Pretty shittastic, huh?! And this is not all the Shitmos Hub Treasury is for or the only way that it can generate revenue.
        </p>
        <h4>4B. The Shitmos Hub Treasury can also accumulate Cosmos “blue chip” coins.</h4>
        <p>
            There is nothing stopping the Shitmos Hub Treasury from accumulating non-shitcoins. The Treasury can accumulate Cosmos blue chip coins such as ATOM, OSMO, AKT, INJ, TIA, etc. Thanks to the Cosmos magic of interblockchain communication built around the ideas of sending tokens from any IBC chain to any IBC chain, an Osmosis-residing token like Shitmos can have a DAO on Osmosis with a Treasury wallet that can accept hundreds of different crypto tokens. So how can the Treasury accumulate these coins, and what could it do with them?
        </p>
        <p>
            Community donations can result in the accumulation of Cosmos blue chip coins. Wait, community members could just gave away Cosmos blue chip coins to the Shitmos Hub Treasury? Why would they do that?! It’s not as crazy as you think. First of all, cultivating a spirit of generosity in a community is a refreshing change from what many have become accustomed to in the crypto space: greed, scams, and value extraction. But secondly, Shitmos can be a place where a spirit of generosity is combined with a capitalistic motivated self-interest to encourage giving for something in return. For example, a signaling proposal has been passed on the Shitmos Hub to allocate 2,222 Shitmos tokens that were donated to the Hub Treasury by a community member for a Shitmos Hub Treasury Bootstrapping Drive. This is resulting in the creation of the first smart contract written by Shitmos community members. The smart contract will give 1 Shitmos token to a donating wallet for each $1 worth of Cosmos blue chip tokens donated to the Treasury. If a community member believes that the Shitmos token will hit a $10 million MC (which means each Shitmos token will be worth $1) then they will get their money back. This also has an interesting side effect of signaling to the world that each donating wallet believes that $1 can be a fair price for Shitmos one day. In addition to this particular donation drive, other donation drives are possible. Join the community and participate in governance to help us decide how we can create the best donation initiatives! By creating a spirit of generosity, even one combined with capitalistic motivated self-interest, we can then create more value propositions for the Shitmos coin, which in turn generates more interest in the Shitmos project. More people converted to Shitmos believers means more Shitmos token buying, which means your bags get pamped.
        </p>
        <p>
            Blue chip Cosmos tokens in the Treasury can then generate revenue for the Treasury to “out-hub” the Cosmos Hub. Once the Treasury acquires blue chip tokens, the community can create and vote on proposals to determine what to do with them. There are many strategies that could be envisioned for what to do with a healthy Treasury consisting of blue chip cosmos tokens, but here is an intriguing thought to activate your imagination: The Treasury DAO wallet can do anything a regular wallet can do, so it can take cosmos tokens and stake them to their respective chain’s validator set. Those staked tokens will then accrue staking rewards. Again, there are many exciting possibilities for what could be done with those staking rewards and ultimately it is up to the community to decide. But if those blue chip staking rewards are sent back to the Treasury, it would be possible for them to be regularly distributed to Shitmos Hub stakers as staking rewards for staking their Shitmos tokens to the Hub. This would lead to an incredible result: Stake Shitmos → Get Cosmos Blue Chips. This is the spirit of the original vision for the Cosmos Hub as port city. It is also the current vision of the Cosmos Hub and its Atom Economic Zone. Shitmos has the potential to “out-hub” the Cosmos Hub.
        </p>

        <h2>Epilogue</h2>
        <p>
            Now that you understand what Shitmos is, what it’s all about, how it works, and how we can land it on the moon, there is one last thing you can do to help the success of Shitmos: go out and evangelize! Ultimately, the success of Shitmos is only limited to the number of people who come to believe in it and want to buy it or, even better, become active community members. So, in a sense, the most important thing that can be done is to grow the community. So how do we do that?
        </p>
        <h3>Growing the Community</h3>
        <p>
            This, of course, is not trivial. People get PhDs in marketing and communications to understand how to reach people and broaden the base of a business or organization. But here are some thoughts based on some non-expert opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Success is the biggest marketing tool. If the Shitmos NFT collection can consistently be in the top 5 in weekly volume, it will get noticed. It’s hard not to notice something that consistently is a top performer. As floor price (hopefully) increases and events such as dingleberries (hopefully) generating more volume, being in the top 5 weekly is very doable. We should be shooting for top 3. Such high volumes will feed directly into the next point…

            The utility must be a resounding success. If holding Shitmos NFTs comes with airdropped rewards from royalties, this is an easy tweet to send out into the world. If we have people on Twitter consistently reminding people of how much money has been returned to NFT holders in the form of Shitmos tokens, that will eventually turn heads and convert people. Additionally, if high volumes become the norm, that adds to the buy pressure of the Shitmos coin. Number goes up, and success is the biggest marketing tool. Same goes for staking Shitmos coins to the Shitmos Hub DAO. If we can get to the point where we can relentlessly tweet about the return we are getting on staking to the DAO, we will attract people and grow the community.

            Keep Shitmos out of Cosmos politics. We all have our opinions on how things are going in Cosmos and what’s right and what’s wrong and who’s good and who’s bad. Obviously, as individuals we can express those opinions. But the “community” and the “Shitmos project” must be an almost outside observer. Throwing spitballs in a South Park sort of way. Shitmos is both above and beneath the drama.

            Nail the Narrative. Any person can advance and enunciate multiple narratives. But nail your narrative. Know your audience. See something on Twitter where a reply enunciating a particular Shitmos narrative would land well? Do it. But nail it. And again, don’t devolve into pure negativity.

            Get people to join the Shitmos Telegram. There will always be concentric circles of people who participate in Shitmos. Out the outer perimeters, people who buy the Shitmos token or Shitmos NFTs but who never, or rarely, interact with the community, promote Shitmos, or are really visible other than their on-chain activity. In the middle circle are the diehard Shitmos stans. There are also layers in between. However, the closer we can get people to the inner circles, the more Shitmos evangelists and enthusiastic participants we have in the community. Those people not only material support the project by buying Shitmos tokens and NFTs, but they participate in governance, promote Shitmos on Twitter, and help to develop new ideas for the success of Shitmos. If you know anyone who may be interested, invite them to the Telegram! They will receive alpha, make some friends, and become more familiar with Shitmos, how it works, and what things are happening. This all adds up to create a more vibrant and diverse community who can then attract more people to the inner circles.

        <h2>Glossary</h2>
        <p>
            There is a lot going on in Shitmos. It can be tough to keep track of everything, and a newcomer may have lots of questions about the various things going on in Shitmos and the terminology involved. This glossary is a non-exhaustive list of Shitmos entities and terms.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>airdrips</strong> – When a new shitcoin launches, it can choose to increase distribution and raise awareness by airdropping their coin to the Shitmos Hub DAO Treasury. These airdrops are called airdrips. Because they’re messy. Yet glorious.</li>
            <li><strong>dingleberries</strong> – Every time a double dribble dumb contract is executed, the Shitmos tokens that would have gone to a wallet holding a Shitmos NFT but does not because it is listed for sale are accumulated as dingleberries. Dingleberries are the shit that is left behind that stick to you after you have taken a shit. As dingleberries accumulate, you need to clean them off. So, occasionally an additional distribution to Shitmos NFT holders will occur to clean out the dingleberries. However, to make things fun and to possibly increase sale volume of the Shitmos NFT collection, the dingleberries are not sent to every NFT holder. Instead, during a live X Spaces event, a randomized wheel will be spun to select which Shitmos NFT trait the dingleberries will go to. So, if the trait chosen is “shit” and “neta”, only the holders of Shitmos NFTs with the neta shit trait will receive dingleberries. This has a couple of salutary attributes: first, because there are only maybe 70 of a specific trait, each of those traits will receive 1/70th of the dingleberries. If there are 1000 dingleberries accumulated, that means 14.28 Shitmos tokens per NFT, much higher than the typically 2.22 that occurs during a double dribble. Secondly, the dingleberry distribution will not occur until approximately a week after the trait is selected. So there is a weeklong period where people can go to the Stargaze marketplace and buy NFTs with those traits, increasing the volume, and therefore royalties, for Shitmos.</li>
            <li><strong>double dribble</strong> – Holders of Shitmos NFTs that are not listed for sale regularly receive Shitmos tokens for being NFT holders. Each NFT held results in 2.22 Shitmos tokens every time the double dribble dumb contract is executed.</li>
            <li><strong>flarnrules</strong> – The creator of Shitmos.</li>
            <li><strong>shitdribbles</strong> – Shitmos tokens that are sent to SEZ member collections.</li>
            <li><strong>shitgeyser</strong> – Shitmos tokens that are sent to the highest performing members of the SEZ. The more royalties a collection generates (and sends to SEZ wallet) the more Shitmos tokens they get.</li>
            <li><strong>Shitmos Economic Zone (SEZ)</strong> – The collection of NFT projects that have pledged to give a small portion of royalties from their collections to the SEZ wallet. Being a member comes with a variety of perks. First, you get plugged into a community of enthusiastic people who are rooting for your success and who can contribute to it by buying your NFTs. Second, holders of your NFTs may be eligible for shitdribbles or shitgeyser.</li>
            <li><strong>Shitmos Economic Zone DAO</strong> – The official DAO of the Shitmos NFT collection. Shitmos NFT holders can stake their Shitmos NFTs to the DAO in order to participate in governance and may also receive other, more material, benefits for staking. This DAO is a “Stargaze-style” DAO that is focused on supporting, promoting, and growing the success of the Shitmos NFT collection and the Shitmos Economic Zone more broadly. The DAO wallet is controlled by the community of people who stake their Shitmos NFTs to the DAO.</li>
            <li><strong>Shitmos Hub DAO</strong> – The official DAO of Shitmos, of the “Osmosis-style” variety. Holders of Shitmos tokens can stake their tokens to the DAO in order to participate in governance and may also receive other, more material, benefits for staking. It is focused on supporting, promoting, and growing the success of the Shitmos token and the Shitmos project more broadly. The DAO wallet is controlled by the community of people who stake their Shitmos tokens to the DAO.</li>
            <li><strong>Shitmos NFT collection</strong> – The official NFT collection of Shitmos. Royalties from the sale of these NFTs go to the Shitmos Economic Zone wallet (with small amounts going to a couple of other wallets), which are then used to distribute Shitmos tokens to Shitmos NFT holders through the double dribble dumb contract.</li>
            <li><strong>Shitmos token</strong> – The official crypto token of Shitmos. There is a total supply of 10 million Shitmos tokens, and there is no inflation.</li>
            <li><strong>shitstrap</strong> – The first smart contract developed by members of the Shitmos community. It is being utilized in the Shitmos Hub Treasury Bootstrapping Drive that aims to acquire $2,222 in blue chip Cosmos coins through a community donation drive in which every dollar of Cosmos blue chip token donated equates to 1 Shitmos token sent to the donating wallet.</li>
        </ul>
